# Constant arrival rate
#  The following example generates 50 virtual users every second for 5 minutes
  phases:
    - duration: 300
      arrivalRate: 50
# The following example generates 10 virtual users every second for 5 minutes, with no more than 500 concurrent virtual users at any given time:
    - duration: 300
      arrivalRate: 10
      maxVusers: 500
#Ramp up rate
#The following example ramps up the arrival rate of virtual users from 100 to 1000 over 5 minutes:
    - duration: 300
      arrivalRate: 100
      rampTo: 1000
# Fixed number of arrivals per second
# The following example creates 1000 virtual users in 60 seconds (one virtual user approximately every 3 seconds):
    - duration: 60
      arrivalCount: 1000
